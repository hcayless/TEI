      <p>Release 3.6.0, the “Potrzebie” release of the TEI Guidelines is a celebration of <title level="j">Mad Magazine</title> and its invention of an imaginary <q>Potrzebie system</q>
        of measurement in its early issues. The name is especially fitting due to a combination of
        factors: <title level="j">Mad Magazine</title> ceases publication of new issues in August
        2019, and the <q>Potrzebie system</q> is represented in an example accompanying a major
        feature of this TEI release: a way of defining nonstandard systems and units of
        measurement.</p>
      <p>The release introduces this and other new features, and it resolves a number of issues
        raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a
        consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub
        tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may
        be found under the <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Guidelines+3.6.0%22+is%3Aclosed">3.6.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>

          <item>New elements, attribute classes, and attributes have been introduced to provide
            information about units of measurement that are not listed in the International System
            of Units, and to document how to convert between systems of measurement (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1707">#1707</ref>):<list>

              <item>The <gi>unitDecl</gi> element provides information about units of measurement
                that are not members of the International System of Units.</item>
              <item>The <gi>unitDef</gi> element contains descriptive information related to a
                specific unit of measurement.</item>
              <item>The <gi>conversion</gi> element defines how to calculate one unit of measure in
                terms of another. <list>
                  <item>The <att>fromUnit</att> attribute indicates a source unit of measure that is
                    to be converted into another unit indicated in <att>toUnit</att>.</item>
                  <item>The <att>toUnit</att> attribute provides the target unit of measurement for
                    a conversion from a source unit referenced in <att>fromUnit</att>.</item>
                </list>
              </item>

              <item>A new attribute <att>formula</att> allows for specification of a mathematical
                formula in XPath. Currently the only member of the new class is the new
                  <gi>conversion</gi> element. The <att>formula</att> is introduced in a new
                attribute class, <name type="class">att.formula</name>, since it may be applicable to a wider
                range of applications than conversion between units of measure.</item>
              <item>The <att>unitRef</att> attribute, a pointer alternative to the <att>unit</att>
                attribute, has been added to the <name type="class">att.measurement</name>
                attribute class. (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1707">#1905</ref>). The <att>unitRef</att> attribute is designed for pointing to an
                  <att>xml:id</att> on the new <gi>unitDef</gi> element.</item>
              <item>Guidelines prose has been written for <title>The Unit Declaration</title> in
                chapter <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HDUDECL">2.3.9</ref>, and a range of supporting examples of the new elements and
                attributes associated with it are provided.</item>
            </list>
          </item>

          <item>A new class <name type="class">model.fsdDeclPart</name> has been introduced.
              <gi>fLib</gi>, <gi>fsDecl</gi>, <gi>fsdLink</gi>, and <gi>fvLib</gi> are now members
            of this class (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1726">#1726</ref>).</item>

          <item>The <gi>note</gi> element is now available within the <gi>witness</gi> element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1728">#1728</ref>).</item>

          <item>The definition of the <gi>msFrag</gi> element has been clarified (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1747">#1747</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1832">#1832</ref>).</item>

          <item>More explanation is provided in the Guidelines on prosopographies referring to
            authoritative external resources on named entities using <gi>idno</gi>, in <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSbp">13.3.1</ref> in response to <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1414">#1414</ref>.</item>

      <p>Documentation of Council practices in <ref target="http://teic.github.io/TCW/tcw20.html">TCW 20</ref> is improved for referencing figures more precisely and

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://roma.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and <ref target="http://oxgarage.tei-c.org/">OxGarage</ref> as well as other TEI conversions). The

        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
