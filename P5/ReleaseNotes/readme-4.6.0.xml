      <p>Release 4.6.0 is codenamed <q>The Peace Release</q>.</p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestone/14?closed=1">4.6.0 milestone</ref>.</p>
      <p>The <q>Peace Release</q> delivers a new Roma v1.0.0, available at <ref target="https://roma.tei-c.org/">https://roma.tei-c.org/</ref>. TEI Roma now has a
        localized user interfaces for English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Japanese, with thanks to
        translators listed on the home page. The original Roma remains available at <ref target="http://romaantiqua.tei-c.org/">http://romaantiqua.tei-c.org/</ref>.</p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>

          <head>New encoding features</head>

          <item>The <gi>calendar</gi> element is now a member of <name type="class">att.typed</name>, giving it the <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2396">#2396</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>lg</gi> element may now contain any of the members of <name type="class">model.pPart.transcriptional</name>, including <gi>supplied</gi>, <gi>redo</gi>, and
              <gi>damage</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2242">#2242</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <att>gender</att> attribute has been added to the elements in <name type="class">model.castItem.part</name> and the <att>sex</att> attribute to the
              <gi>actor</gi> element for the encoding of cast lists in
            performance texts (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2400">#2400</ref>).</item>
          <item><gi>vColl</gi> elements may now self-nest, so that the TEI specifications match the
            Guidelines prose (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2034">2034</ref>).</item>
        </list>

        <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>It is anticipated that in a future release the content model of the
              <gi>content</gi> element will require that it have one and only one child element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2381">#2381</ref>). Thus a Schematron
	      warning for ODD
              writers  about this upcoming change has been added to
	      this release  (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2410">PR #2410</ref>). </item>
	</list>

	<list>
          <head>Changes to classes</head>
	  <item>The <name type="class">model.glossLike</name> class
	  (which contained <gi>altIdent</gi>, <gi>equiv</gi>, and <gi>gloss</gi>)
	  has been renamed to <name type="class">model.identSynonyms</name>.</item>
        </list>

        <list>
          <head>Improvements of prose and examples</head>

          <item>The <gi>biblStruct</gi> element now has a new example featuring the use of a
              <att>type</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1773">#1773</ref>).</item>

          <item>An outdated link in an example in <name type="class">att.global</name> was updated
            with a new example from a current archive, and the Bibliography was updated to reflect
            the change (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2366">#2366</ref>).</item>

          <item>A misrepresented source for an example in the
            Manuscript Description chapter was corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2372">#2372</ref>).</item>

          <item>To improve consistency, many <gi>desc</gi> elements were converted to <gi>gloss</gi>
            elements and vice versa, and underscores were removed from glosses in several element
            specifications (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2388">PR
            #2388</ref>).</item>

          <item>The explanation of the attribute <att>ns</att> has been clarified in <name type="class">att.namespaceable</name> to indicate more precisely that it refers to an
            element being defined (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2395">#2395</ref>).</item>

          <item>In addition, several typos, unclear expressions, and faulty encodings have been
            corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2252">#2252</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2403">#2403</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2387">#2387</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2225">#2225</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2375">PR #2375</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2356">#2356</ref>).</item>

          <head>Housekeeping</head>

          <item>The TEI oXygen framework has been updated to
 	    accommodate the fact that versions 25+ of oXygen use Saxon 11 (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2251">#2251</ref>) </item>

            <item>The <gi>title</gi> elements with <att>ref</att>
            attributes used to refer from the Guidelines to some
            external standards have been replaced with <gi>ref</gi>
            elements with <att>target</att> attributes both for
            internal consistency of encoding and to ensure their
            values are properly processed as links (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2368">#2368</ref>).</item>

        </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22Release+7.55.0%22">7.55.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>Highlights of this release include:<list>

      <item>Information about attributes assigned to an attribute
      class via an <gi>attRef</gi> that refers to another attribute
      class (as opposed to class membership via <gi>memberOf</gi> or
      attribute definition via <gi>attDef</gi>) was not showing up in
      the documentation specification pages; this has been fixed (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/419">#419</ref>).</item>

          <item>Infelicitous spacing in <gi>egXML</gi> was corrected with resetting the HTML output
            declaration to prevent indentation (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/pull/599">PR #599</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrected a problem with processing the
          <att>minOccurs</att> attribute on <gi>attDef</gi> — when set
          to <val>0</val> <att>minOccurs</att> was behaving as if
          it had been set to <val>1</val> unless <att>maxOccurs</att>
          was <val>unbounded</val> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/557">#557</ref>).</item>

          <item>Cases of an <gi>attDef</gi> with a <att>mode</att> of
          <val>delete</val> that was inside an <gi>attList</gi> that
          was itself inside an <gi>attList</gi> were not being
          processed; this was corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/pull/601">PR
          #601</ref>).</item>

          <item>In processing ODDs, the contents of <gi>code</gi>
	  elements within <gi>desc</gi> were being dropped from the
	  RELAX NG output; this was corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/pull/514">PR #514</ref>).</item>

          <item>Improved the documentation of the <code>$cssInlineFiles</code> parameter (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/538">#538</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrected serious problems in <name type="file">Test/test.odd</name> with invalid
            and undocumented values of the <att>atts</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/329">#329</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrected a problem in the OxGarage conversion of XLSX spreadsheets to TEI in which
            empty cells were being omitted (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/323">#323</ref>).</item>
