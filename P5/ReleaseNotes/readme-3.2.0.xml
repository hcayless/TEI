      <p>This release (code name: <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar">Telstar</ref>) is
      the first in some time not to introduce any major new changes to
      the TEI Guidelines. The Council has focused mainly on fixing
      bugs and on tidying up parts of the Guidelines that needed
      attention.</p>
      <p>
        Highlights of this release include:
        <list>

          see the <ref target="https://packages.tei-c.org/deb/">TEI
          Debian Package page</ref> for instructions and pointers to
          both the <name style="font-family:monospace;">.deb</name>

      of typographic errors have been made to the
      <title>Guidelines</title>.</p>

      <p>Many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets

      well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained
