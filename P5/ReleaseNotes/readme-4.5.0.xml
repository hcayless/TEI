          <item>Some constraints in <name type="exemplar">tei_customization</name> have been removed

        </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+7.54.0%22+is%3Aclosed">7.54.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>Highlights of this release include:<list>

          <item>The <name type="file">odds/odd2odd.xsl</name> program now copies over the attributes
            of the children of <gi>content</gi> in order to retain attributes like
              <att>preserveOrder</att> declared on the source element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/241">#241</ref>).</item>

          <item>An XSLT template has been added to <name type="file">common/common_core.xsl</name>
            that prevents the content of the <gi>index</gi> element within the <gi>head</gi> element
            from being displayed in the table of contents (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/382">#382</ref>).</item>

          <item>A warning has been added to <name type="file">epub/epub_common.xsl</name> and <name type="file">tools/makegraphicsanttask.xsl</name> in case the xml:id a <att>facs</att>
            attribute refers to does not exist (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/476">#476</ref>).</item>
          <!-- The conversation on the associated PR is where David
                 Maus made his now famous “I consider the Stylesheets
                 as broken beyond repair. They work <sic>for a</sic>
                 to a certain degree<corr>,</corr> but they are, from
                 my point of view, effectively unmaintainable.”
                 assertion. -->

          <item>A bug in the processing of <gi>constraintSpec</gi> was fixed in <name type="file">odds/odd2odd.xsl</name> by changing the XSL keys in which <gi>constraintSpec</gi>
            elements are looked up to use only the value of the <att>ident</att> attribute only;
            and, when processing <gi>elementSpec</gi>, <gi>dataSpec</gi>, <gi>macroSpec</gi>, or
              <gi>classSpec</gi> seeking all descendant <gi>constraintSpec</gi> elements, not just
            child <gi>constraintSpec</gi> elements (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/541">#541</ref>).</item>

          <item>The attribute <code>classpathref="classpath"</code> has been added to <name type="file">common/teianttasks.xml</name> to allow the TEI Stylesheets to be called
            from external scripts that will submit the classpath location (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/544">#544</ref>).</item>

          <item>The whitespace differences that have caused errors in RNC when running the tests
            were prevented by adding <code>-bBw</code> switches to the <code>diff</code> commands
              (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/560">#560</ref>).</item>

          <item>The issue with un-escaped hashes when transforming teitolatex has been fixed by
            applying the template for text nodes and its <code>tei:escapeChars()</code> function to
            the computed link text of pointers which are processed in the <val>xref</val> mode (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/565">#565</ref>).</item>

          <item>The examples of the show-all-examples pages have been appended with an indication
            that the user is about to go into a different language version of the Guidelines (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/571">#571</ref>).</item>
