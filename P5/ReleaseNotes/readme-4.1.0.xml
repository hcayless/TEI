      <p>Release 4.1.0 is codenamed <q>Wash your hands and wear a mask!</q></p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Guidelines+4.1.0%22+is%3Aclosed">4.1.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>

          <item>Chapter 11, <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/4.1.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html">Representation of Primary Sources</ref>, has been restructured. In addition, the
            language on the usage of <gi>sourceDoc</gi> for encoding spatial features and
              <gi>text</gi> for encoding textual phenomena has
            been clarified (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1427">#1427</ref>).</item>

          <item>The guidelines on encoding short-form citations with bibliographic details using the
              <att>corresp</att> attribute on the <gi>bibl</gi> element have been expanded (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1431">#1431</ref>).</item>

          <item>The <soCalled>minimal</soCalled> exemplar TEI customization has been entirely
            replaced with a new version (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1540">#1540</ref>).</item>

          <item>A constraint on the usage of the <att>restriction</att> attribute on the
              <gi>dataRef</gi> element has been added: <att>restriction</att> can only be used
            together with the <att>name</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1606">#1606</ref>).</item>

          <item>Most of the exemplar ODD customizations have been <soCalled>purified</soCalled> —
            converted to use the ODD language, not RELAX NG, to describe element content models
              (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1609">#1609</ref>).</item>

          <item>The class membership of <gi>q</gi> has been changed. In the course of this, the
            element class <name type="class">model.qLike</name> was renamed to <name type="class">model.attributable</name>. Consequently, the use of the <gi>q</gi> element is
            allowed in additional contexts (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1918">#1918</ref>), including <list>
              <item>the <gi>byline</gi> element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1858">#1858</ref>), and</item>
              <item>the <gi>span</gi> element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1658">#1658</ref>).</item>
            </list>
          </item>

          <item>The <gi>surplus</gi> element has been added to the content model of <gi>subst</gi>.
            The <gi>subst</gi> element must have at least one child <gi>add</gi> and at least one
            child <gi>del</gi> or <gi>surplus</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1661">#1661</ref>).</item>

          <item>A new datatype, <name type="datatype">teidata.authority</name> has been
            introduced. Its value may be either a value from an enumerated list defined in the
            document's schema, or a URI (ostensibly referring to an authority list that is not in
            the document's schema). The new datatype is used by the <att>where</att> attribute of
            the <gi>move</gi> element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1769">#1769</ref>).</item>

          <item>A new attribute class <name type="class">att.lexicographic.normalized</name>
            holding the attributes <att>norm</att> and <att>orig</att> has been introduced. The
            existing attribute classes <name type="class">att.lexicographic</name> and <name type="class">att.linguistic</name> are now members of the new attribute class (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1776">#1776</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1973">#1973</ref>), thanks to Piotr
            Bański.</item>

          <item>The elements <gi>interp</gi>, <gi>interpGrp</gi>, <gi>span</gi>, and
              <gi>spanGrp</gi> are now members of the attribute class <name type="class">att.typed</name> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1844">#1844</ref>).</item>

          <item>The <gi>titlePage</gi> element and most elements from the classes <name type="class">model.titlepagePart</name> and <name type="class">model.frontPart.drama</name> are now available in the <gi>rdg</gi> and <gi>lem</gi>
            elements (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1848">#1848</ref>).</item>

          <item>Further discussion of editorial theory and practice has been added to chapter 12,
              <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/4.1.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html">Critical Apparatus</ref> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1849">#1849</ref>).</item>

          <item>A discussion of the use of <gi>witDetail</gi> without <att>target</att> has been
            added to chapter 12, <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/4.1.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html">Critical
              Apparatus</ref> — such a <gi>witDetail</gi> refers to the closest preceding
              <gi>rdg</gi> or <gi>lem</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1852">#1852</ref>).</item>

          <item>The rendering of the <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/4.1.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DEPRECATIONS.html">Deprecation Appendix</ref> has been improved (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1854">#1854</ref>).</item>

          <item>The class <name type="class">model.graphicLike</name> and the <gi>pc</gi> element
            have been added to the content model of the <gi>cit</gi> element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1914">#1914</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1891">#1891</ref>).</item>

          <item>The datatype of the <att>role</att> attribute of the <gi>org</gi> element has been
            changed from <name type="datatype">teidata.word</name> to <name type="datatype">teidata.enumerated</name> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1908">#1908</ref>).</item>

          <item>Multiple <gi>seriesStmt</gi> elements are now allowed in the TEI Header and in the
              <gi>biblFull</gi> element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1998">#1998</ref>).</item>

          <item>The content model of the <gi>standOff</gi> element, which functions as a container
            for linked data, contextual information, and stand-off annotations embedded in a TEI
            document, has been further extended with the introduction of new elements, classes,
            extensions of content models, and related explanations (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2018">#2018</ref>): <list>
              <item>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element contains a list of annotations, typically
                encoded as <gi>annotation</gi>, <gi>annotationBlock</gi>, or <gi>note</gi>, possibly
                organized with nested <gi>listAnnotation</gi> elements.</item>
              <item>The <gi>annotation</gi> element represents an annotation following the Web
                Annotation Data Model.</item>
              <item>The class <name type="class">model.annotationLike</name> groups elements used
                to represent annotations.</item>
              <item>The class <name type="class">model.annotationPart.body</name> groups elements
                which may be used as an <gi>annotation</gi> body.</item>
            </list>
          </item>
        
        <item>The <gi>pron</gi> element is now a member of the attribute class <name type="class">att.typed</name> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2020">#2020</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrections of typographic errors and broken links, improvements on explanations,
            and corrections of examples, constraints and references have been conducted in various
            sections of the Guidelines (including <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1781">#1781</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1980">#1980</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1982">#1982</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2025">#2025</ref>).</item>

        </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="http://oxgarage.tei-c.org/">OxGarage</ref> as well as other TEI conversions).
        The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
