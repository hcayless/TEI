      <p>Release 4.3.0 is codenamed <q>dot-dot-dot</q>.</p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Guidelines+4.3.0%22+is%3Aclosed">4.3.0 milestone</ref>.</p>


      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>
          <head>New encoding features</head>

          <item>The new element <gi>ellipsis</gi> has been introduced
          for encoding a purposeful marking in the source document
          that indicates a passage has been omitted, and optionally
          supplying the omitted passage if available (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1877">#1877</ref>). </item>

	  <item>The <att>where</att> attribute of <gi>event</gi> —
	  used to reference a location by pointing to entries in a
	  canonical list of places — has been moved to a new attribute
	  class, <name type="class">att.locatable</name>, and
	  <gi>event</gi> is a member of the new class (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1910">#1910</ref>). </item>

	  <item>The <gi>conversion</gi> element has been made a member
	  of the new <name type="class">att.locatable</name> class,
	  allowing encoders to specify where a particular conversion
	  calculation is or was applicable.</item>
