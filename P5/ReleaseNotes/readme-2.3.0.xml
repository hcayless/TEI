      <p> This version of the TEI introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by
        the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a
        consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community, using the SourceForge
        tracking system. If you find something you think needs to change in the TEI Guidelines,
        schemas, tools, or website, please submit a feature request or bug ticket at <ref target="http://tei.sf.net/">http://tei.sf.net/</ref> for consideration.</p>
      <p> Since the last release (25 October 2012), the TEI Technical Council has closed 93 tickets
        entered in the SourceForge tracking system. During the same period 77 new tickets have been
        opened by the community according to <ref target="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tei/stats/tracker?tracker=&amp;dates=2012-10-25+to+2013-01-17">
          https://sourceforge.net/projects/tei/stats/tracker?tracker=&amp;dates=2012-10-25+to+2013-01-17</ref>.</p>

      <p>Some of the highlights of the TEI P5 2.3.0 release include: <list>
          <item>The creation of an <name type="class">att.source</name> class resulting from <ref target="http://purl.org/tei/bugs/3572502">http://purl.org/tei/bugs/3572502</ref> in order to standardise the provision of the
              <att>source</att> attribute for pointing to one or more sources of a bibliographic
            reference. Currently, the elements <gi>quote</gi>, <gi>q</gi>, <gi>writing</gi>, and <gi>egXML</gi> claim membership in this class.</item>
          <item>A change of the <name type="class">att.sourced</name> class to <name type="class">att.edition</name> (to avoid confusion with the above), and the creation of an
              <att>edRef</att> attribute to provide one or more pointers to the source edition in
            which the associated feature (e.g. page, column, or line break) occurs.</item>
          <item>The addition of a schematron constraint to check that there is a <att>type</att>
            attribute if there is a <att>subtype</att> attribute; also <gi>abbr</gi> and <gi>title</gi> now get their <att>type</att> from <name type="class">att.typed</name> and so will now get a <att>subtype</att> attribute as well. </item>
          <item>The creation of a <gi>media</gi> element to indicate the location of any form of external media (such as
            an audio or video clip); also the creation of a new <name type="class">att.media</name> class which provides <att>width</att>, <att>height</att>, and
              <att>scale</att> attributes. </item>
          <item>A change to <gi>label</gi> to claim membership in <name type="class">att.placement</name> (for the <att>place</att> attribute) and <name type="class">att.typed</name> in response to <ref target="http://purl.org/tei/fr/3527821">http://purl.org/tei/fr/3527821</ref></item>
          <item>A tightening up of the use of morphological elements inside <gi>cit</gi> necessitating some of them to be wrapped in the <gi>gramGrp</gi> element in response to <ref target="http://purl.org/tei/bug/3547289">http://purl.org/tei/bug/3547289</ref>
          </item>
          <item>Revising section <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/2.3.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ST.html#STGAxs">1.3.1.1.5 on XML Whitespace</ref> for further clarity in response to a community
            contribution. </item>
          <item>Removal of the default value from the definition of the <att>marks</att> attribute
            on <gi>quotation</gi>. It was decided that a default value is unhelpful since the element
            is optional and affects the interpretation of the whole document; also the content model
            of <gi>quotation</gi> was changed from one or more <gi>model.pLike</gi> elements to zero or more of these allowing it to not have any child
            elements.</item>
          <item>The creation of <gi>listPrefixDef</gi> and <gi>prefixDef</gi> to define prefixing schemes used in <gi>data.pointer</gi> values, showing how abbreviated URIs using the scheme may be
            expanded into full URIs. This is a powerful mechanism for providing a method allowing
            full documentation of private URI schemes which are then able to be dereferenced using
            the information in the <gi>prefixDef</gi> element. New prose was added to describe this at <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/2.3.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SAPU">16.2.3 - Using Abbreviated Pointers</ref></item>
          <item>A change to elements which claim membership in <gi>model.certLike</gi> in that this class has been added to the content model of <gi>space</gi> in response to <ref target="http://purl.org/tei/bugs/3565137">http://purl.org/tei/bugs/3565137</ref> allowing them to now be used here. </item>
          <item>The <att>type</att> attribute on <gi>biblScope</gi> has been deprecated and replaced with a <att>unit</att> attribute for
            greater clarity. The <att>type</att> attribute will be removed at a future
            release.</item>
          <item>The <gi>locusGrp</gi> element has been added to the content model of <gi>msItemStruct</gi>, giving encoders a choice between <gi>locus</gi> or <gi>locusGrp</gi>, in response to <ref target="http://purl.org/tei/fr/3575433">http://purl.org/tei/fr/3575433</ref></item>
          <item>The <gi>citedRange</gi> element has been added inresponse to <ref target="http://purl.org/TEI/FR/3555191">http://purl.org/TEI/FR/3555191</ref> in order
            to enable users to document in a bibliographic reference the range within a larger text
            that is being cited.</item>
          <item>Many tickets reporting small bugs such as typos, inconsistencies, or places where
            greater clarity was needed in the Guidelines. The TEI Technical Council would encourage
            any such reports, so if you spot a problem, please do let us know by filing a bug at
              <ref target="http://purl.org/tei/bug">http://purl.org/tei/bug</ref>.</item>
