      <p>Release 4.0.0 is codenamed <q>Galileo</q> in honor of
      Galileo's arrival to Rome on 13 February 1633 to face the
      Inquisition. We associate Galileo with decentering the earth in
      official western dogma of the universe. Similarly, the stand-off
      model in this release of the TEI Guidelines may serve to decenter our models of
      digital texts and expand our frames of reference. With the addition of <gi>standOff</gi>, 
        a significant change in how characters outside of Unicode are described, and the ability of <gi>TEI</gi> to self-nest, 
        this version is significantly different than previous versions, 
        and thus deserves an increase in the “major” release number.</p>
      <p>In addition to the stand-off model, this release introduces new features and resolves a number of
      issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of
      these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature
      requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub
      tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the
      course of this release cycle may be found under the <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Guidelines+4.0.0%22+is%3Aclosed">4.0.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in
      this release: <list>

      <item>The <gi>standOff</gi> element functions as a container
      element for linked data, contextual information, and
      stand-off annotations embedded in a TEI document (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/374">#374</ref>, thanks to Laurent Romary and Piotr Bański).
      </item>
      
      <item>With the introduction of the <gi>standOff</gi> element a
      new structural class
      <name type="class">model.describedResource</name> has
      been introduced, and <name type="class">model.resourceLike</name> has been revised and renamed <name type="class">model.resource</name>.</item>
        
      <item>As the <gi>TEI</gi> element is a member of the new <name type="class">model.describedResource</name> class, it can now
      be a child of another <gi>TEI</gi> element.</item>

      <item>The new <gi>standOff</gi> element:
      <list>
	<item>is a child of <gi>TEI</gi> (or
	<gi>teiCorpus</gi>);</item>
	<item>may contain stand-off annotations, for example
	morphosyntactic annotations encoded with <gi>spanGrp</gi> or
	<gi>annotationBlock</gi>;</item>
	<item>may contain stand-off markup, for example a series of
	<gi>certainty</gi>, <gi>linkGrp</gi>, or <gi>alt</gi>
	  elements;</item>
	<item>may contain contextual information, for example
	<gi>listPerson</gi> and <gi>listPlace</gi>;</item>
	<item>may contain information that must be pointed to from
	elsewhere, but is not found in the source document, for
	example a <gi>castList</gi> that represents characters who
	speak in a drama, but whose roles are not listed in the source
	document's printed cast list.</item>
      </list></item>

	<item>New elements, attributes, and an attribute class have
	been introduced for using Unihan properties in TEI (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1805">#1805</ref>, thanks to Duncan Paterson):
	<list>
            <item>The attribute class <name type="class">att.gaijiProp</name> provides attributes for
            defining the properties of non-standard characters or
            glyphs.
	      <list>
                <item>The <att>name</att> attribute provides the name
                of the character or glyph property being
                defined.</item>
                <item>The <att>value</att> attribute provides the
                value of the character or glyph property being
                defined.</item>
                <item>The <att>version</att> attribute specifies the
                version number of the Unicode Standard in which this
                property name is defined. A list of suggested values
                is provided.</item>
              </list>
            </item>
            <item>The <gi>localProp</gi> element provides a locally
            defined character (or glyph) property.</item>
            <item>The <gi>unicodeProp</gi> element provides a Unicode
            property for a character (or glyph).</item>
            <item>The <gi>unihanProp</gi> element holds the name and
            value of a normative or informative Unihan character (or
            glyph) property as part of its attributes. A list of legal
            values from the <ref target="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/">Unicode Han
            Database</ref> is provided for the <att>name</att>
            attribute on <gi>unihanProp</gi>.</item>
            <item>The use of the elements <gi>charProp</gi>,
            <gi>charName</gi>, <gi>localName</gi>,
            <gi>unicodeName</gi>, and <gi>value</gi> has been
