      <p>Release 4.4.0 is codenamed <q>Ukraine Solidarity</q>.<note place="foot">The TEI-C has contributed to a <ref target="https://e-editiones.org/cultural-heritage-grant-ukraine/">small
      grant program</ref> started by e-editiones aiming to help
      scholars of Ukrainian cultural heritage whose work has been
      disrupted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to continue their
      efforts.</note></p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Guidelines+4.4.0%22+is%3Aclosed">4.4.0 milestone</ref>.</p>
      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>The <gi>listRef</gi> element is now a member of the element class <name type="class">model.ptrLike</name>. Furthermore, constraints on the use of <gi>listRef</gi> within
              <title>Documentation Elements</title> have been added
              and the corresponding remarks have been updated.
              (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1667">#1667</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2209">#2209</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>graphic</gi> element is now a member of the attribute class <name type="class">att.typed</name>. A corresponding example has been added to the
            specification (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1999">#1999</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>constraintSpec</gi> element has been added to elements that get copied to
            p5subset (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2187">#2187</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>stage</gi> element is now member of the attribute class <name type="class">att.written</name>
            (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2197">#2197</ref>).</item>
          <item>The constraint that an <gi>objectIdentifier</gi> must
          have at least one child element was moved from the
          Schematron schema to the Relax NG schema.(<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2260">#2260</ref>).</item>
          <item>In release 4.1.0, <name type="class">att.interpLike</name> became a member of
          <name type="class">att.typed</name>, in preference to its
          previously locally-defined <att>type</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2012">#2012</ref>).
          Due to a yet unfound (let alone solved) bug in the
          Stylesheets this caused an egregious error in the HTML
          output. Thus this change has been reverted until such time
          as the bug can be fixed: <name type="class">att.interpLike</name> is no longer a member of
          <name type="class">att.typed</name> and locally defines
          both <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2270">#2270</ref>).</item>
        </list>
        <list>
          <head>Improvements of prose and examples</head>
          <item>The descriptions of the legal values of the <att>mode</att> attribute in the
            attribute class <name type="class">att.combinable</name> have been clarified (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1715">#1715</ref>).</item>
          <item>The description of the <val>URI</val> value of the <att>type</att> attribute of the
              <gi>idno</gi> element has been improved (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2071">#2071</ref>).</item>
          <item>The prose in the subsection on <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/4.4.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DS.html#DSGRP">Grouped Texts</ref> has been updated (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2203">#2203</ref>).</item>
